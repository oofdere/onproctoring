# Information about this project
This repository serves multiple purposes:
1. Archiving and sharing evidence on misdoings of online proctoring services et al. (i.e. schools and other institutions they work with) in a somewhat decentralized/takedown-resistant fashion.
2. Organizing this evidence so that it is easily navigable by the public.
3. Voicing our concerns to teachers/professors, administrators, and the general public about this software.
4. Protesting against the usage of flagrant lawsuits to quell dissent.
5. Protesting and protecting against the gross misuse of DMCA to take down valid criticism based on public information
