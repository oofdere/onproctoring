# Quick guide to archiving web content
## Web pages
1. Make a copy at the Internet Archive [here](https://archive.org/web/).
2. Make a secondary copy at [archive.today](https://archive.today/). (other services are available too, for instance https://perma.cc/)
3. Share those links far and wide.
4. Make a local copy of the web page. (the [WARCreate extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/warcreate/kenncghfghgolcbmckhiljgaabnpcaaa?hl=en-US) is the preferred method)
5. Submit your archive as a pull request to this repository. If you need help with this, open an issue.

## Audio/Video
1. [Download youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html)
2. In a command prompt, in the folder you downloaded it to, run `youtube-dl <URL OF VIDEO/PLAYLIST/CHANNEL>` [(more options documented here)](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md)
3. Re-upload videos to as many platforms as possible, particularly censorship-resistant ones like PeerTube.
4. Let people know that you archived/reuploaded the content.
