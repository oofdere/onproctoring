## Privacy
Proctorio claims on their ["Privacy by design"](https://proctorio.com/about/privacy) page that "Maintaining Test-Takerâ€™s privacy is at the core of our product, not an afterthought."

They claim that they use "Zero Knowledge Encryption" yet its CEO was able to somehow identify a student from their Reddit username and post a chat session they had with Proctorio support. Not only can they access this information, for any reason and at any point, but the CEO is, or at least was, flagrantly willing to showcase that ability. I thank him for that.

Proctorio also claims that it "never requires personally identifiable information (PII) to use our software." This is hilarious considering that part of their offering is the ability to record students taking an exam, providing upon request access to microphone, webcam, and screen recordings.

It's also hilarious because of the amount information that the Proctorio extension has access to. On the same page, they outline that the extension can look at all the websites you visit, read your clipboard, manage your downloads, identify and eject your storage devices, manage apps and extensions, and change your browser's privacy settings.

But the best part is that, according to Google's assessment, Proctorio also collects
 - **Personally identifiable information** - For example: name, address, email address, age, or identification number
 - **Financial and payment information** - For example: transactions, credit card numbers, credit ratings, financial statements, or payment history
 - **Personal communications** - For example: emails, text or chat messages, social media posts, or conference calls

You might need to pay for Proctorio so it's not all that shocking that the first two points are there, although Proctorio for some reason vehemently denies that they collect that information.

But that last one is particularly baffling. You could argue that perhaps I'm exchanging exam info over one of these mediums, but that doesn't mean a professor nor Proctorio should have access to those, even on suspicion. This is effectively wiretapping, without the warrant. Proctorio is a police force without regulation.

## False Advertising
As of 2/4/2021, Baylor University is still listed on Proctorio's homepage, despite them announcing in August 2020 that they would discontinue its usage starting with the Fall 2020 semester. (https://twitter.com/Linkletter/status/1355736367880265729)
